A Command-line search application

###Installation

###Run

###Assumptions
1. Filenames of the data map to the Search entities

###Design Decisions
1. Data can be loaded to the memory with no issues, even when we use Maps.
2. We do not need free text search and the search is based on entity and the fields.
